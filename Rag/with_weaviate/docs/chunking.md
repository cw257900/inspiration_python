### Emerging Trends in Chunking

Chunking is a sub-field of generative AI and is evolving as fast as the technology. A few trends to look out for in the near future are -

    Enhancements in the context awareness of chunks
    Adaptive chunking that adjusts chunks dynamically based on the use case.
    Evolution of agentic chunking into a more sophisticated task-oriented process.
    Multimodal chunking is designed to segment not only text but other unstructured form of data like images, audio and video.
    Deeper integration with knowledge graphs to maintain connections to broader concepts.
    Real-time and responsive chunking for edge devices and low-latency systems.
