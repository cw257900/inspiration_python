# Chunking and Embedding

## Chunking Strategy

Options:
- **Extract Text**: Tools like `PyPDF2` or `pdfminer`.
- **Semantic Splitting**: OpenAI GPT, Hugging Face models, or `LangChain`'s `RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter`.

Selected:
- **CharacterTextSplitter** and **RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter**

---

## Embedding Strategy

Options:
- When to Embed: Pre-embed vectors before loading to Weaviate, or let [Weaviate embed](https://weaviate.io/developers/weaviate/concepts/vector-quantization) during object creation. <br>
- What models to use <br>
    openai: 
    > text-embedding-3-large, dimensions: 3072 <br>
    > text-embedding-ada-002, dimensions: 1536 <br>
    > text-embedding-3-small,dimensions: 1536 <br>
    
    cohere: 
    > model: nname=multilingual-22-12, dimension=768,semgments=384, 256, 192, 96
    
    huggingface: 
    > sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L12-v2, dimention=384, segments=192, 128, 96

Selected:
- Weaviate to embed: text2vec-openai text-embedding-ada-002, dimensions: 1536, max token 8191
```
    vectorizer_config=
            wvc.config.Configure.Vectorizer.text2vec_openai(
                model="text-embedding-ada-002",
                name="page_content",
                source_properties="page_content"
            ),    # Set the vectorizer to "text2vec-openai" to use the OpenAI API for vector-related operations
            generative_config=wvc.config.Configure.Generative.cohere(
                name="tiles", 
                source="page_content"
            ),             
```

## Embedding Approach Analysis


### Pre-Embedded Vector Approach

1. Embed PDF chunks using external models (e.g., `LangChain OpenAIEmbeddings`).  
2. Store vectors directly in Weaviate, bypassing its internal embedding module.

### Pros:
- Full control over model selection and preprocessing.
- Avoids Weaviate module costs and dependencies.

### Cons:
- More complex embedding management outside Weaviate.

---

## With `moduleConfig` (using `text2vec-openai`)

1. Weaviate handles embedding via `text2vec-openai`.
2. Embedding happens automatically during object creation.

### Pros:
- Simplifies embedding process; direct integration with OpenAI.
  
### Cons:
- Dependent on external services; less control over the process.

## Key Differences

- **Control**:  
  - Without `moduleConfig`: Full control over embeddings.  
  - With `moduleConfig`: Weaviate manages embeddings.
  
- **Process**:  
  - Without: You handle embeddings externally.  
  - With: Weaviate handles everything.

- **Costs**:  
  - Without: Avoids Weaviate API costs.  
  - With: API costs via Weaviate modules.

- **Flexibility**:  
  - Without: Switch models easily.  
  - With: Tied to Weaviateâ€™s modules.
