Step-by-Step Plan

    Install Required Libraries:
        Pinecone (for vector database)
        PDF parsing libraries like pdfplumber or PyMuPDF to extract text, tables, and images from PDFs.
        transformers or any other embedding models (Hugging Face models, OpenAI API for embeddings).
        PIL (for images).


    pip install pinecone-client pdfplumber transformers Pillow

    Parsing Files:

        For PDFs, use pdfplumber or PyMuPDF to extract text, tables, and images.
        For JSON, read the structure and extract data accordingly.

    Embedding the Parsed Data:

        Use a text embedding model for text (e.g., OpenAI text-embedding-ada-002).
        For images, use a vision model (e.g., CLIP from Hugging Face).
        For tables, you can either convert them to text or use specialized table embedding models.

    Saving Embeddings to Pinecone:

        After generating embeddings for text, images, and tables, store them in Pinecone using their API.


pip install pymupdf
pip install pdfplumber
pip install pinecone-client
pip install python-dotenv
pip install openai
