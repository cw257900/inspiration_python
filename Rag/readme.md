1. Weaviate: <br>

   Weaviate integrates well with Hugging Face, OpenAI, Cohere, and other model providers for automatic vector creation. <br>
   It provides GraphQL and REST API support, which can make complex queries easier. <br>
   Weaviate is designed for building applications that require more than just vector search, offering extensive extensibility via plugins. <br>
   Self-Hosted: Weaviate is open-source, so you can self-host it without paying for licenses. However, the cost of managing infrastructure (servers, storage, etc.) will depend on your setup. <br>
   Managed Service: Weaviate Cloud is a managed service where you pay based on usage (compute, storage, queries), but the pricing can vary depending on your deployment size. <br>
